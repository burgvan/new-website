                            <p class="project__client-text">As a UX design lead for optimizing the medical cannabis brand's website while working at Canopy Growth, the navigation and content were the main problems that needed to be solved to create a seamless experience for health professionals and patients. The biggest problem was the navigation was first built using three different web services (AEM, Shopify and a portal) which resulted in a general broken experience for both health professionals and patients, as well as for logged-in users.</p>

                            <h3 class="project__client-heading">Results</h3>
                            <p class="project__client-text">The initial idea was to merge all three web services into one, where I had a more seamless solution with Shop being integrated but this decision, later on, had to change due to budget and priority adjustments. I ended up changing the initial solution slightly to meet the new technical requirements and split into a three-tabbed approach, whereas the initial approach was to only keep Health Professionals and Patients separated with Shop merged in Patients with a more consistent logged-in experience. Along with the navigation redesign, I also proactively made recommendations on improving content.</p>

                        <p class="project__description-text">
                        I needed to understand both health professionals and patients in the medical cannabis space. I asked for some preliminary research that was conducted a while back, and I took the initiative to plan and test both user groups to explore the website and current navigation for general observation to validate some existing UX issues and develop concrete hypotheses. I wanted to observe how different they are in navigating through the site while being asked particular task questions. We also identified through insights from Customer Care that there was a problem for existing customers noticing the confusing changes between AEM and Shopify navigation that seem to be the same but don't have consistent login status. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The user research was done via UserTesting for flexibility and time efficiency as the project had a tight deadline along with other tasks I managed. As a reminder, during this time at Canopy Growth, we were only a team of three UX designers.</p>

                        </h5>
                        <p class="project__description-text">For the first round of testing, it was more for general observation as a start and to develop more concrete hypotheses. Here are the following key insights from testing with 14 participants (6 health professionals + 8 patients):</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Only some of the health professionals said they would consider registering with the brand due to <strong>not feeling 100% confident</strong> about medical cannabis and how to introduce it in their practice. This indicated that there wasn't enough content regarding how to integrate medical cannabis into their practice and how it can benefit their patients.</li>
                        <li>Most of the health professionals liked the Research page because it demonstrates that <strong>The medical brand has lots of knowledge of medical cannabis</strong> which invokes trustworthiness. This indicated that displaying research studies provides credibility and authority.</li>
                        <li>A few patients thought the <strong>info on THC/CBD was too complex for them with not enough info on conditions/illnesses.</strong> This means there is a need to know how to effectively speak to their audience.</li>
                        <li>Some expected The Spectrum page to be an About Us page when asked about <strong>finding info about Spectrum products and the science behind it.</strong> This means the title could be misleading and there should be more content about the Spectrum products on the Shopify website as users were going back and forth between the AEM and Shopify website. This occured on both rounds of testing.</li>
                        <li>Most explored the <strong>Patients and The Spectrum pages</strong> to learn about the company and medical cannabis. If this is the ideal end goal when navigating to those two pages, then ensure those pages meet the users' expectations with the appropriate labels and content.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="project__description-text">
                        I was working collaboratively with the product manager and key stakeholders. We also facilitated an in-person workshop with stakeholders to get a better understanding of the key health professional personas using preliminary research, what they know about health professionals in the medical cannabis space, as well as using the findings from the UserTesting to instigate discussions for the website. The workshop had provided interesting views on the medical cannabis space overall, beyond the digital experiences as well.</p>

                       <p class="project__description-text">After I compiled the discussion points from the workshop into experience maps, we finalized the proposed navigation (in a split between Patients and Health Professionals) and planned a phased approach to improving the content for health professionals.

                        As for the Patients' side of the user journeys, I took some of the insights from the first and second rounds of testing in parallel with the content strategy. I used the second round of testing on the new navigation in phase one to further improve it from the patients' perspective. I combined the qualitative research with Adobe Analytics to further refine the IA and content strategy. The analytics helped guide the IA and content strategy on where users are commonly looking at using Adobe's heatmaps and what links they are clicking the most on certain pages.
                         </p>
                         <p>As part of the process of re-designing the navigation, I created sitemaps and user flows to demonstrate the new structure more easily at a glance for stakeholders and developers to understand. This also helped the creation of a content strategy along the way.</p>

                        Overall, for the navigation re-design, I lead it from discovery and planning to the interaction design, while collaboratively working with stakeholders. I was working closely with the front-end developers to ensure the vision was met which later was slightly adjust after another round of testing on the live website. I also made sure that the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and Shop navigations were about 100% the same as they were developed by different developers. I used JIRA to communicate with developers on updates. 
                         </p>
                         <p class="project__description-text">The navigation went through some iterations before and after the second round of testing (more so on Patients side), along within a phased approach due to lack of immediate content. The end result of the new final navigation would not only support a more seamless experience for each user group but also support a clear journey to more educational content once new content would be developed.</p>

                        Based on these insights and usability heuristics, along with how improving key product pages can mitigate risks and increases conversions, the team agreed on which key webpages and content to improve on in a phased approach due to timing and resources. I proposed a small UX and business strategy to the team for them to understand why making these improvements would be important for the customers and the medical brand.
